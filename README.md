Introduction:
This project involves the development of a predictive model for forecasting the stock prices of six different companies: Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Twitter (TWTR). The model aims to predict the stock prices for the next three days based on historical data obtained from XML files.

Objective:
The primary objective of this assignment is to create a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast the future prices of the selected stocks. By analyzing historical stock data, the model will learn patterns and trends to make informed predictions for the next three days.

Data Collection:
Six XML files containing historical stock data for Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, and Twitter have been provided for this assignment. Each XML file contains relevant information such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume for a specific time period.

Model Development:
The predictive model is developed using machine learning techniques, particularly time series analysis and forecasting algorithms. The model will be trained on the historical stock data extracted from the XML files. Feature engineering techniques may be employed to extract relevant features from the data, and preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling may be applied to enhance model performance.

Prediction:
Once the model is trained, it will be used to predict the stock prices for the next three days for each of the six companies. The predictions will be based on the patterns and trends learned from the historical data. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this assignment involves the development of a predictive model for forecasting stock prices using historical data from XML files. By accurately predicting future stock prices, this model can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions about their investment strategies.
